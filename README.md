# SocketStream 0.4 Early Experimentation

SocketStream is a Realtime Web Framework with a focus on high performance and extensibility.

[View Latest Changes](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream-0.4/blob/master/HISTORY.md)


## What's going on here?

I'm releasing previews of 0.4 as it takes shape over the coming months. While the code here is incomplete and subject to change, you should always be able to run the example app (see below for instructions).


## Goals

* high performance
* minimal bandwidth
* reliability at scale
* easy to get started
* transport agnostic
* minimal client-side code
* excellent mobile compatibility
* idiomatic Node.js code style throughout
* lazy-load only the parts you choose to use
* chooses simplicity and high performance over SEO compatibility
* provide APIs to support Models, Presence and more (as Stream Services)
* only absolute essentials live in the core
* personal tastes (e.g. CoffeeScript) supported via optional modules


## New Modular Design

The SocketStream framework is a 'meta module' which integrates the following standalone modules for maximum productivity:

**[socketstream-server](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream-0.4/blob/master/mods/socketstream-server/README.md)** SocketStream Realtime Server. Responds to requests over websockets
**[socketstream-client](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream-0.4/blob/master/mods/socketstream-client/README.md)** SocketStream Realtime Client. Connect to the server from the browser or other Node process

TODO: Separate out Single Page Client and Asset Building.


## What's working so far?

Right now we have basic client-side asset serving (excluding templates) working. We also have basic PubSub, RPC and Live Reload working over the websocket. These are all implemented as Realtime Services (the new name for Request Responders), however the API will need to change to allow each service to be tested. There are many big problems still to solve such as how best to do sessions, auth, and connection status. Expect frequent commits.

If you see a better way to architect or design something, **please** let me know or submit a pull request. Nothing is set in stone at this stage and my primary concern is getting the design right for the long term.


## Why SocketStream

Integrating all the bits you need to make a high-performing, scalable realtime web app is hard.

At one end of the scale there's Meteor: a great all-in-one solution, but one that forces you to do everything their way or the highway. At the opposite end is the myriad of individual Node modules which can be plugged together to create the tech stack of your dreams - but this takes a lot of time, knowledge and patience.

Somewhere in the middle of these two extremes lies SocketStream. A modular and highly extensible framework which integrates best-of-breed modules to solve common problems. We take care of all the boring stuff (serving client code as modules, session, asset packing, etc) so you can dive straight in and start creating your app.

Add whatever functionality your app needs (e.g. RPC, PubSub, Realtime Models) by combining Realtime Services together, then take advantage of our slick build system which wires up everything on your behalf. Best of all, everything is implemented as standalone `npm` modules, so you're free to change any part of it in the future without having to start from scratch.


## Warning

**0.3 users:** Don't be alarmed. What you see here is completely unfinished and missing many of the essential features present in SocketStream 0.3. They will return over the coming weeks.

**New users:** If you're looking for something stable and reasonably mature, please use SocketStream 0.3 until further notice.

Note: I've deliberately put this code in a new repo so we can discuss crazy new ideas in Github Issues without scaring or confusing existing 0.3 users. I'll move the code over to the `master` branch of the main repo when I feel the API is relatively stable and the overall design is sound.


## Try it out

Early adopters and hackers only for now!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream-0.4
cd socketstream-0.4
[sudo] npm install
cd mods
./npm_link_all.sh
cd ..
```

Then run the example app (there's no app generator yet)

```bash
cd example_app
./npm_link_all.sh
[sudo] npm install
node app.js
```

Note: Stylus and Jade won't be required to use SocketStream 0.4, nor will any of the other optional modules. They're just included in this repo to aid development for now.


## API

```js
var SocketStream = require('socketstream'),
    app = SocketStream();
```

##Â Tutorial

This is a step-by-step tutorial which shows you how each component of SocketStream can be combined together.

Tip: Create a new directory and a new file called `app.js`. Copy and paste each example to follow along.


#### 1. Web Servers 101

Let's start with the most basic web server you can build with Node:

```js
var http = require('http')

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

Nice and simple. But how do we go from this to a web server that can send different HTML, JS and CSS depending upon the URL and device connecting?

At the very heart of SocketStream is the concept of Single Page Clients.

While you may easily combine SocketStream with other multi-page frameworks, SocketStream is **only** concerned with delivering all the CSS, JS, HTML and Client-side Templates a single page app needs in one go (though we will support optional async loading of assets later on, as we did in 0.3).


#### 2. Defining a Single Page Client

Let's create a new SocketStream app and define our first Single Page Client:

```js
var http = require('http'),
    SocketStream = require('socketstream'),
    app = SocketStream();

// Define a Single Page Client
var mainClient = app.client('main.html');

// Start the HTTP server
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  mainClient.html().pipe(res)
}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

Here we have:
  
  1. Created a new Single Page Client based upon the HTML found in 'main.html'
  2. Piped the raw HTML to the HTTP `res` (response) object

To try this example, create a file called `main.html` in your project directory, and paste in the following:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SocketStream Tutorial</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then run your app with `node app.js` and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see Hello World! on the screen.

By creating multiple Single Page Client's you're able to easily serve different assets to different devices, or on different URLs, without duplicating files. 


####Â 3. Delivering Assets

HTML is all well and good, but a Single Page App needs CSS, client-side JS, and other assets to function.

These can be defined by passing an object to the second argument of `app.client()` containing a list of files to be sent whenever this client is served.

SocketStream ensures assets are loaded in the most optimal order, allowing files to be easily debugged in development and packed & cached in production (yet to be implemented in 0.4).

Update your code now to include a CSS file called `main.css`:

```js
// Define a Single Page Client
var mainClient = app.client('main.html', {
  css: ['main.css']
});
```

And create the `main.css` file in your project directory:

```css
body {
  background-color: #BBBBFF;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

List as many CSS files as you want. If you pass the name of a directory, all files inside will be served alphanumerically.

We're almost done, but we need to tell SocketStream to:

1. Inject asset tags into the HTML view (in the most optimal order)
2. Watch out for incoming requests for asset files and serve them

Hence our final code now looks like:

```js
var http = require('http'),
    SocketStream = require('socketstream'),
    app = SocketStream();

// Define a Single Page Client
var mainClient = app.client('main.html', {
  css: ['main.css']
});

// Start the HTTP server
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {

  if (req.url === '/') {
    mainClient.html()
      .pipe(mainClient.injectAssetTags())
      .pipe(res);
  } else {
    app.serveAssets(req).pipe(res);
  }

}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

Run `node app.js` again and note the pale blue background color.


#### 4. Streams Everywhere!

Before we clean up this code, it's worth stating that Single Page Clients output data in the form of standard Node Streams.

This means you can easily pipe() the HTML to another output interface:

```js
mainClient.html().pipe(process.stdout);  // outputs the HTML to the terminal
```

Or pipe it through code pre-processors:

```js
var jade = require('jade-stream'); // a simple streaming wrapper around Jade
mainClient.html().pipe(jade()).pipe(res);
```

Or even gzip the output. Altogether now:

```js
var jade = require('jade-stream'),
    oppressor = require('oppressor'); // thanks SubStack!

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {

  mainClient.html()
    .pipe(jade())
    .pipe(mainClient.injectAssetTags())
    .pipe(oppressor(req))
    .pipe(res);

}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');
```

So if you need this level of ultra-fine grain control for your app, you'll always have it.


#### 5. Tidying Up

As pre-processing and gzip compression are things we believe are **essential for every web app**, we've created a nifty helper method called `view()` which does this all for you, in the right order, automatically.

```js
var http = require('http'),
    SocketStream = require('socketstream'),
    app = SocketStream();

// Define Code Preprocessors
app.preprocessor('jade', require('./jade-stream')());

// Define a Single Page Client
var mainClient = app.client('main.jade', {  // note we're using Jade in this example
  css: ['main.css']
});

// Start the HTTP server
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {

  if (req.url === '/') {
    mainClient.view(req).pipe(res);
  } else {
    app.serveAssets(req).pipe(res);
  }

}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

Note the new `app.preprocessor()` command. Here we're telling SocketStream to always stream the output of `.jade` files through the `jade-stream` module (a simple wrapper we've built until Jade supports Streams), thus outputting HTML.


#### 6. HTTP Routing

Let's continue cleaning things up by introducing the basic HTTP router that's included in SocketStream.

You don't have to use it (feel free to use Express, mapleTree or another module for routing), but the SocketStream router provides a handy feature you're going to need to build a modern Single Page App: support for HTML5 PushState routing.

Let's assume you have defined two Single Page Clients `mainClient` and `adminClient`. You'd like `mainClient` to be served when visitors hit the root URL `/` and the internal `adminClient` if you visit `/admin`.

We can define these routes with the `app.route()` command as so:

```js
app.route('/', mainClient);
app.route('/admin', adminClient);
```

To ensure your app can make full use of PushState routing (as used by the Backbone Router), incoming URLs will be recursively matched until the correct route is found. E.g. a request for `/admin/products/123` will correctly serve the `/admin` client.

Let's wire this up by passing the `app.router()` function to `http.createServer()`. The completed code looks like:

```js
var http = require('http'),
    SocketStream = require('socketstream'),
    app = SocketStream();

// Define a Single Page Client
var mainClient = app.client('main.html', {
  css: ['main.css']
});

// Define Routes
app.route('/', mainClient);

// Start the HTTP server
var server = http.createServer(app.router()).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

Note: `app.router()` will automatically send requests through to `app.serveAssets()` if a main route cannot be found.

Finally, how can we serve a different client depending upon the connecting device? Simply pass a function as so:

```js
app.route('/', function(req, res){
  if (req.headers['user-agent'].match(/iPad/)) {
    ipadClient.view().pipe(res);
  } else {
    mainClient.view().pipe(res);
  }
});
```


#### 7. Coming soon

That's all for now. I'm building the API Guide and Tutorial bit by bit as each section is complete and I'm reasonably happy with the API.

I will document the new `app.service()` command soon.



## Major changes since 0.3 so far

* Vanilla JavaScript for maximum readability
* Request Responders are now provisionally called Services
* Live Reload, PubSub and RPC are now implemented as bundled Services (all lazy-loaded)
* No need to structure your app dir in a particular way (though still recommended!)
* More emphasis on providing an API and Tutorial and less on generating / modifying files
* Asset tags are now injected into HTML automatically
* Supports multiple instances
* No longer logs to `console.log` by default
